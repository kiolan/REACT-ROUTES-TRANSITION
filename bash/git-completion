# bash completion support for core Git.

# Conceptually based on gitcompletion (http://gitweb.hawaga.org.uk/).
# Distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.0.
#
# The contained completion routines provide support for completing:
#
#    *) local and remote branch names
#    *) local and remote tag names
#    *) .git/remotes file names
#    *) git 'subcommands'
#    *) tree paths within 'ref:path/to/file' expressions
#    *) common --long-options
#
# To use these routines:
#
#    1) Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-completion.sh).
#    2) Added the following line to your .bashrc:
#        source ~/.git-completion.sh
#
#    3) Consider changing your PS1 to also show the current branch:
#        PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
#
#       The argument to __git_ps1 will be displayed only if you
#       are currently in a git repository.  The %s token will be
#       the name of the current branch.
#
#       In addition, if you set GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE to a nonempty
#       value, unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next
#       to the branch name.  You can configure this per-repository
#       with the bash.showDirtyState variable, which defaults to true
