# bash completion support for core Git.

# Copyright (C) 2006,2007 Shawn O. Pearce <spearce@spearce.org>
# Conceptually based on gitcompletion (http://gitweb.hawaga.org.uk/).
# Distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.0.
#
# The contained completion routines provide support for completing:
#
#    *) local and remote branch names
#    *) local and remote tag names
#    *) .git/remotes file names
#    *) git 'subcommands'
#    *) tree paths within 'ref:path/to/file' expressions
#    *) common --long-options
#
# To use these routines:
#
#    1) Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-completion.sh).
#    2) Added the following line to your .bashrc:
#        source ~/.git-completion.sh
#
#    3) Consider changing your PS1 to also show the current branch:
#        PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
#
#       The argument to __git_ps1 will be displayed only if you
#       are currently in a git repository.  The %s token will be
#       the name of the current branch.
#
#       In addition, if you set GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE to a nonempty
#       value, unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next
#       to the branch name.  You can configure this per-repository
#       with the bash.showDirtyState variable, which defaults to true
#       once GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE is enabled.
#
#       You can also see if currently something is stashed, by setting
#       GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE to a nonempty value. If something is stashed,
#       then a '$' will be shown next to the branch name.
#
#       If you would like to see if there're untracked files, then you can
#       set GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES to a nonempty value. If there're
#       untracked files, then a '%' will be shown next to the branch name.
#
#       If you would like to see the difference between HEAD and its
#       upstream, set GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM="auto".  A "<" indicates
#       you are behind, ">" indicates you are ahead, and "<>"
#       indicates you have diverged.  You can further control
#       behaviour by setting GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM to a space-separated
#       list of values:
#           verbose       show number of commits ahead/behind (+/-) upstream
#           legacy        don't use the '--count' option available in recent
#                         versions of git-rev-list
#           git           always compare HEAD to @{upstream}
#           svn           always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream
#       By default, __git_ps1 will compare HEAD to your SVN upstream
#       if it can find one, or @{upstream} otherwise.  Once you have
#       set GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM, you can override it on a
#       per-repository basis by setting the bash.showUpstream config
#       variable.
#
#
# To submit patches:
#
#    *) Read Documentation/SubmittingPatches
#    *) Send all patches to the current maintainer:
#
#       "Shawn O. Pearce" <spearce@spearce.org>
#
#    *) Always CC the Git mailing list:
#
#       git@vger.kernel.org
